          I am a junior Ruby developer keen to contribute to the right company. I have taught myself how to code in my spare time and currently I am a volunteer instructor at <a href="http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">CodeFirst:Girls</a> teaching young professional women HTML and CSS. I am a committed and a fast learning individual who’s ready to tackle on any challenges.

        <h2 class="aboutme-subheading">History</h2>

        <p>
          I started coding at the age of 12 with simple HTML and CSS, making free layouts for a blogging platform called <a href="www.xanga.com">Xanga</a>. Little did I know I was actually coding! I never Googled anything in terms of what the different parts of HTML/CSS did, what I had done was purely based on trial and error. However, school became hectic and I had to put my hobby on hold.

          Fast forward to 2016, I became curious what else is out there after finishing my Master's degree. I came across <a href="http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">CodeFirst:Girls</a> whilst searching the web and signed up to their upcoming event in Fintech. From there I signed onto their Advanced Ruby course at level 39 which ran for 8 weeks. I found it difficult to get to grips with coding in Ruby, however this only motivated me to continue after finishing the course!

        <p>
          I then started to attend more events and workshops geared towards the tech industry, and soon realised that my passion lies in software engineering! I am now working on becoming a better software engineer day by day and can't wait until I can make that leap! I am currently working on some side projects which you can visit by clicking <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mywork">here</a>.
